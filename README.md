## What's this?
This tool will allow you to create new certification for building 2K3 source code.

## Which program should i use to open generate.sh?
You need to install **Strawberry Perl** and **Git** to your system,<br>
And then you need to open **Git Bash** and launch **./generate.sh** to create new certifications.


I already included the certificate files so you dont need to create new one until these got unvalidated!
